# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Dependencies** - Added to package.json:
   - `express-validator`: ^7.0.1
   - `multer`: ^1.4.5-lts.1
   - `firebase-admin`: ^11.11.1
   - `@types/multer`: ^1.4.11

2. **Health Check Timeout** - Increased to 300 seconds

3. **Build Configuration** - Verified TypeScript config is correct

## üîÑ Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - add missing dependencies"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Railway
Go to your Railway project dashboard and add these variables:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/metoo-app
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment
- Check Railway build logs
- Verify the build completes successfully
- Test the health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`

## üö® Common Issues to Watch For

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MONGO_URI is correct and MongoDB Atlas allows Railway IPs
2. **Environment Variables**: All required variables must be set
3. **Build Errors**: Check for any remaining missing dependencies
4. **Port Issues**: Railway handles this automatically

## üìã Pre-Deployment Verification

- [x] All dependencies added to package.json
- [x] TypeScript configuration is correct
- [x] Build scripts are properly defined
- [x] Health check endpoint exists
- [x] Railway configuration files are present
- [ ] Environment variables set in Railway
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Deployment monitored

## üîç If Deployment Still Fails

1. Check Railway build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure MongoDB Atlas network access allows Railway IPs
4. Check that file paths are correct (case-sensitive on Linux)
5. Review the troubleshooting guide: `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
