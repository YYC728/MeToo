Absolutely! Here’s a comprehensive, developer-ready specification document based on everything we discussed. I’ve structured it clearly for easy handoff to your development team:

# University Meal Exchange & #MeToo Story Sharing App

**Specification Document**

---

## 1. Overview

This app serves university students by providing two independent but coexisting features under a unified platform:

* **Meal Exchange:** Students can post, browse, and exchange batch-cooked meals.
* **#MeToo Story Sharing:** Students can share their experiences related to harassment and support each other via anonymous stories and discussion threads.

---

## 2. User Accounts & Authentication

* **Single Unified Account** for both features.
* Registration requires:

  * Verification via university email (to confirm affiliation).
  * Users may choose a **stage name** instead of real name.
* University affiliation visibility is **optional** (users decide whether to disclose it).
* Users can toggle anonymity in the #MeToo section when posting or commenting.

---

## 3. Meal Exchange Feature

### 3.1 Posting Meals

* Meals can be scheduled for availability from **today up to 7 days ahead**.
* Required meal details:

  * Dish name
  * Dietary group (predefined options, e.g., vegan, halal, gluten-free)
  * Portion size (e.g., 1 serve, 2 serves)
  * Pickup location (based on GPS coordinates)
  * Pickup time window
  * Allergen information
  * Optional additional notes

### 3.2 Meal Discovery

* Meals are shown as markers on a **map interface** using GPS locations.
* Users can filter and search by combining:

  * Dietary groups
  * Portion sizes
  * Location radius or map area
  * Time windows
  * Allergens
* Freeform search text (optional).

### 3.3 Interaction

* Users can **freely message** any other user within the app (not limited to meal-related contacts).
* Notifications for messages, new meals near user location, etc., can be toggled on/off per user preference.
* No rating or review system.

## 4. #MeToo Story Sharing Feature

### 4.1 Story Posting

* Stories can be:

  * Text only, or
  * Include media uploads (images, audio, video).
* Privacy controls for each story:

  * **Public:** anyone (inside or outside app) can view/share.
  * **Restricted:** only logged-in app users can view.
  * **Anonymous:** identity hidden but shareable externally.
* Users can add **tags** to their stories from predefined or custom tag categories.

### 4.2 Story Interaction

* Anonymous **comment/support threads** attached to each story, visible only to the original poster and commenters.
* Comments can be enabled/disabled by the story poster.
* Supportive reactions and likes allowed.
* Sharing stories outside the app is enabled.

### 4.3 Community Help

* The anonymous comment section serves as a **peer-to-peer anonymous support group**.
* Users can block or disable comments for safety.
* In-app notifications for comments and reactions, toggleable by user.

---

## 5. Messaging & Safety Features

* Free messaging across users.
* Users can block others and disable comments for safety.
* The #MeToo section prioritized as a **safe space**.
* Reporting tools for inappropriate content/messages are community-driven, no admin dashboard.

---

## 6. Notifications

* Users can toggle notifications for:

  * New messages
  * New meal listings nearby
  * New comments or reactions on #MeToo stories
* Notification preferences fully user-controlled.

---

## 7. Search & Filtering

* Meals: multi-filter search (diet, portions, location, allergens, time).
* \#MeToo stories: search by keywords and filter by tag categories.

---

## 8. Technical Architecture

### 8.1 Frontend

* Mobile app (iOS and Android) or responsive web app.
* Core UI components:

  * Map with geolocation and markers for meals.
  * Post creation forms for meals and #MeToo stories.
  * Messaging interface.
  * Profile and settings screens (privacy, notifications).
  * Story view with comment/support thread.

### 8.2 Backend

* RESTful or GraphQL API server.
* User authentication with email verification.
* Secure storage of user data, media uploads, and posts.
* Real-time messaging and notifications (e.g., using WebSocket or push notifications).
* Database design to separate meal posts, #MeToo stories, comments, user profiles, and settings.
* Media handling: storage and streaming (consider cloud services like AWS S3).

### 8.3 Security & Privacy

* Ensure anonymity where requested (e.g., #MeToo posts and comments).
* Data encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest.
* GDPR/CCPA compliance regarding personal data.
* Abuse prevention mechanisms: blocking, reporting, disabling comments.
* Rate limiting and spam detection for messaging and posting.

## 10. Error Handling Strategies

* Graceful form validation errors with clear messages.
* Fallbacks for media upload failures (retry mechanism).
* Connection loss handling in messaging (offline queue).
* Map location services fallback if GPS unavailable.
* Robust authentication error feedback.
* User-friendly error screens for unexpected failures.

---

## 11. Testing Plan

### Unit Testing

* Validate input forms for meal posts and #MeToo stories.
* Authentication flows and email verification.
* Privacy toggling and anonymity enforcement logic.
* Message sending/receiving and blocking functionality.
* Search and filtering logic for meals and stories.

### Integration Testing

* End-to-end posting and discovery of meals.
* Posting, sharing, and interacting with #MeToo stories.
* Notifications toggle and delivery.
* Anonymous comment/support thread visibility rules.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

* Test anonymity options in various scenarios.
* Verify user preference toggling (privacy, notifications).
* Usability of map and meal listing UI.
* Verify media uploads and sharing outside app.
* Confirm safe space features: blocking, disabling comments, reporting.

### Security Testing

* Verify email verification enforcement.
* Test data encryption in transit and storage.
* Penetration tests for messaging and media upload.
* Abuse scenarios: spamming, harassment prevention.
